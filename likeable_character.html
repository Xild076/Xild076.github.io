<hr>
<p>After reading a lot of random books recently, I began to wonder: What makes a character likable?</p>
<p>This question consistently boggled me. Among the many books I’ve read, some "good guys" were completely unlikable, some "bad guys" were compelling enough to root for (not out of dislike for the protagonist, but because they were more interesting), and some anti-heroes or villains left me utterly confused.</p>
<p>(As a preface, all the following statements are based on my own personal feelings and emotions when I read books and are and should not be reflective of how other people are supposed to feel about stories.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, the answers I found online were even more absurd—there were statements about how "making them funny and/or competent" or making their "positive traits must be their defining characteristics over their negative ones" would make a character likable. While I do think those are common in likable characters, I do not think those are the reasons that they are likable.</p>
<p>Instead, I think that the character's goals and/or values ultimately determine if they are likable or not (that and good writing lol). However, it isn't in making the goals and motivations characters have relatable, though that is part of it. I ultimately think that to make a likable character, their goal, values, and/or motivation need to be grounded in the fulfillment of an individual, whether it be themselves or one of the other characters. </p>
<p>What I mean by this is that when a likable character has a final goal, it can't be an ideology, a material object, or a concept—it has to be the well-being of a person. For instance, a character's final goal should not be to obtain unlimited power, the legendary lightsaber, or universal democracy, rather, it should be their own happiness, the happiness of their friends or family, or even the happiness of a pet.</p>
<p>That is not to say that getting unlimited power, a legendary lightsaber, or universal democracy isn't a bad goal init of itself, it is a nice stepping goal to have, especially for a fun story, but it can't be the final goal. The power, lightsaber, or democracy has to be obtained for the sake of somebody, otherwise, the character is not likable, they are just fun.</p>
<p>Primarily, this idea is grounded in personal feeling, but it is also grounded in aspects of Kantian philosophy. Kantian's second principle dictates calls individuals to "Treat people as an end, and never as a means to an end". In the case of stories, when characters place people as ends, I believe that it creates an inherent affinity between the reader and the character out of empathy.</p>
<p>This would also explain the negative feelings I have against certain "good-aligned" protagonists. In a certain trope that has been popping up more and more recently, the protagonist is betrayed, travels back in time, and gets their revenge. However, when I read these stories, I often end up despising the protagonist almost as much as I despise the antagonist. Looking deeper, I believe the reason for that is that these characters treat their comrades or companions as a means to revenge. This is certainly unethical according to Kant's principle, and I am led to believe that this is what creates a feeling of dislike towards those characters. </p>
<p>This idea is further reinforced by a story from this trope that I actually liked. In this story, the main character's entire driving force was not revenge against what killed them but to protect those they held dear, which aligned perfectly with Kantian ideals. I also ended up finding the character very likable and the story very enjoyable.</p>
<p>Thus, given all of this, I believe that, to write a likable character, one must write a character who puts people as their final, ultimate goal. Though, take all this with a grain of salt—I am no psychology, English, or philosophy guru, I'm just a guy who really likes reading books. </p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
