I've been getting pretty busy with my school's speech and debate and swim, however, I've got some time to write a small blog, so I shall do so.</p>

<p>Today, I wanted to talk about media polarization. It's an issue that has come up often when working on (you guessed it ;D) Alitheia AI, and it's both a scary and interesting thing to think about.</p>

<p>I was reading about it in the article <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://sites.bu.edu/pardeeatlas/advancing-human-progress-initiative/back2school/how-the-american-media-landscape-is-polarizing-the-country/"><em>How The American Media Landscape is Polarizing the Country</em> by Flavia Roscini</a>, and it talked about two main points. One of these points is about social media, media misinformation, and algorithmic echo chambers, and that is another pickle entirely to consider, so, I'll focus more on the other point. </p>

<p>The first point that the article makes is that traditional media has developed a destructive business model. Due to growing competition with new news sources emerging, traditional media needs to shift its model to stay afloat, and the model they shifted to is one that prioritizes entertainment, exaggeration, and opinion above fact and information. Seeing our modern-day political landscape, it has evidently succeeded, although it has succeeded too much.</p>

<p>Although there are a few media sources like AP News that have relatively avoided the shift, they lack the sensationalism of other news articles, making them less popular when compared to their sensational and entertainment-geared counterparts. The issue is, each of these media sources still market themselves as 'news', which instills a false sense of trust within said news source even if they may not deserve it.</p>

<p>Echo chambers, reinforcement, and tribal mentality have all contributed to the collapse of critical thinking, reflection, and collaboration, and it is both saddening and upsetting to think. The fact that a desperate shift in the business model could lead to grand political polarization is so absurd it's almost fascinating, and yet it happened.</p>

<p>However, all meta-commentary talk aside, something that really caught my eye was some failed solutions the article mentioned—</p>

<p><em>"Therefore, Klein hypothesizes that the solution may be for liberals to watch more of Fox News and for conservatives to tune into MSNBC. However, studies have shown that hearing contrary opinions drives partisans towards 'not just a deeper certainty in the rightness of their cause but more polarized policy positions.'"</em></p>

<p>While it seems counterintuitive, it is a pattern we can see all over society. When told a long-held position is wrong, most people don't accept it—in fact, they often double down on it. I can attest to this myself—in the past, I've had some small political leanings and I tried to read the opposite news source, however, it did very little to sway my position. </p>

<p>However, that brings up the question: how exactly do we stop this polarization if exposing a person to the opposite news source does not work? While I come up with a solution, I do have a few small ideas on the issue. </p>

<p>Firstly, looking at the direct opposite news source is probably bad. The opposite news source often demonizes their opponents, which would very likely decrease the chances of an individual from the opposite group reading said news source. If read, it would also likely increase polarization as seen in the study as the individual would feel personally attacked. If I were to bring up a news source to read, it would probably be best to consider either center or subtly aligned news sources. I would recommend something like the <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-chart">Allsides Media Bias Chart</a> as a good reference. This way, individuals might be more open to accepting the ideas presented in the news.</p>

<p>Secondly, consuming a lot of news is important. I mentioned this in my other blog about types of bias, but I believe that contextual bias is prevalent in modern media, where certain bits of information are intentionally removed to promote a certain story or perspective. Thus, I think to prevent polarization, having a holistic understanding of the news is very important. However, that is definitely a strain on time, as I doubt most people have enough time to read through multiple news articles instead of just glimpsing the headlines.</p>

<p>While both of these are things I'm attempting to integrate into Alitheia AI, I do recognize avoiding this polarization is very, very difficult unless one can have a completely detached view of politics, which is nearly impossible. However, I think it is very important for everyone, especially in today's time of polarization, to realize that the news we see and consume is often extreme. In the end, all the people reading this news and participating in polarization can be considered victims of polarization, and I think we need to recognize that there are still other people in the end.</p>
