                    <h3>Example</h3>
                    <p>Imagine creating a mobile app to track homework. You'd first brainstorm features (like reminders or a calendar). Next, you prototype a simple version. You test it, gather feedback (e.g., users find the interface confusing), then iterate â€“ redesigning it. You might collaborate with a classmate where one handles front-end design and the other back-end logic. Together, you produce a better app. This illustrates Big Idea 1: creativity and iteration leading to an improved computational artifact.</p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Data and information facilitate the creation of knowledge. This Big Idea explores how we collect, process, analyze, and visualize data to gain insights. Computing enables handling large datasets, finding patterns, and deriving meaning. The cycle is often Data â†’ Information â†’ Knowledge.</p>

                    <h3>Detailed Concepts</h3>
                    <h4>Data Collection and Generation</h4>
                    <p>Data comes from sensors, transactions, surveys, user content, etc. Modern tech generates <strong class="key-term">Big Data</strong>. Challenges include volume, cleaning, and privacy.</p>
                    <span class="definition">Extremely large data sets (e.g., billions of records) that require specialized tools and techniques for analysis due to their volume, velocity, or variety. Analyzing big data can reveal complex patterns and trends.</span>

                    <h4>Data vs. Information vs. Knowledge</h4>
                    <p><strong class="key-term">Data</strong>: Raw facts, figures (e.g., a list of numbers). <strong class="key-term">Information</strong>: Processed, organized, meaningful data (e.g., an average). <strong class="key-term">Knowledge</strong>: Interpreted information leading to understanding (e.g., "this month was hotter").</p>
                    <span class="definition">Data: Raw values or facts without context. Information: Data processed or organized to have meaning. Knowledge: Insights or understanding gained from information.</span>
                    
                    <h4>Processing and Cleaning Data</h4>
                    <p>Raw data is often messy. Processing includes <strong class="key-term">Cleaning Data</strong> (fixing errors, normalizing formats), <strong class="key-term">Filtering Data</strong> (isolating relevant subsets), combining sources, <strong class="key-term">Clustering</strong> (grouping similar data), and <strong class="key-term">Classification</strong> (assigning labels).</p>
                    <span class="definition">Cleaning Data: Correcting or removing inaccurate records, standardizing formats to prepare raw data for analysis. Filtering Data: Selecting a subset of data based on criteria. Clustering: Grouping data points with similar attributes (unsupervised). Classification: Assigning data to predefined categories based on features (supervised).</span>

                    <h4>Visualization and Communication</h4>
                    <p><strong class="key-term">Visualization</strong> (charts, graphs) helps humans understand complex data. Choosing the right type and clear labeling are crucial. Interactivity enhances communication.</p>

                    <p>Enable discovery but pose challenges in storage, processing power, and privacy. Specialized tools (databases, MapReduce) are used. <strong class="key-term">Metadata</strong> (data about data, e.g., timestamps, source) is crucial for context and filtering.</p>
                    <span class="definition">Data about data. Examples: a photo's metadata might include date taken, camera type, location; a data table's metadata might be column descriptions or data source info.

                            <li>Security vs. Convenience: Strong security can be less convenient.</li>
                            <li><strong class="key-term">Lossless Compression</strong> vs. <strong class="key-term">Lossy Compression</strong>: Lossless perfectly reconstructs data (e.g., PNG, ZIP) with moderate size reduction.

                        <li><strong>Incremental Development:</strong> Build programs in small, manageable, testable pieces (modules/functions), then integrate them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Testing and Debugging:</strong> Continuously test with various inputs (including edge cases) to find and fix errors (<strong class="key-term">Bugs</strong>). Debugging is a critical skill.</li>

                    <h4>Implementing Algorithms</h4>
                    <p>Programs execute algorithms. High-level code (Python, JavaScript) is translated into machine instructions. Understanding program flow (sequential, altered by loops/conditionals/function calls) is key.</p>
                    <p><strong class="key-term">Variables</strong> store data that can change. They are named storage locations, initialized with values, and can be updated.</p>
                    <span class="definition">A named storage location in a program that holds a value which may change during program execution (e.g., `score`, `userName`, `temperature`). In AP pseudocode: `x <- 5` assigns 5 to x.</span>
                    <p>Programs use memory (for variables/data) and a CPU (to execute instructions), and involve input/output.</p>

                    <h4>Abstraction in Programs</h4>
                    <p>Programming is facilitated by abstractions that manage complexity:</p>

                        <li><strong class="key-term">Parameters</strong>: Inputs to procedures that allow them to work with different data, generalizing solutions and avoiding code duplication.
                             <span class="definition">An input variable for a procedure/function, used to pass data into it so it can operate on that data. Parameters make procedures more flexible and reusable.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong class="key-term">Return Values</strong>: Output from a function sent back to the caller.
                            <span class="definition">The output of a function that is sent back to the part of the program where the function was called. In AP pseudocode, `RETURN (value)` is used.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Data Abstractions:</strong> Structures like <strong class="key-term">Lists (Arrays)</strong> organize data, simplifying management (e.g., one list of 100 items vs. 100 variables).
                            <span class="definition">A data structure that stores an ordered collection of items, which can be of mixed types. Elements are accessed by an index. In AP CSP, lists are 1-indexed.</span>

                        <li><strong class="key-term">Libraries/APIs</strong>: Collections of pre-written procedures for common tasks (e.g., graphics, data analysis). Using them is an abstraction.
                            <span class="definition">Library: A collection of pre-written code (functions, procedures, classes) that provides functionalities for common tasks, allowing programmers to reuse code. API (Application Programming Interface): A set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software components; it defines how different software pieces can communicate.</span>

                    <h3>Example: Simple Game Development</h3>
                    <p>To create a character-collects-coins game: 1. **Plan:** Outline movement, collision, scoring. 2. **Incremental Coding:** Get character moving, then add one coin and collision logic, then multiple coins (using a list for coin positions â€“ a data abstraction). Test at each step. 3. **Abstraction:** A function `checkCollision(character, coin)` returns true/false. A function `moveCharacter(direction)` updates position. 4. **Testing:** Test coin collection, movement boundaries. 5. **Documentation:** Add comments. This iterative, abstracting, testing approach improves correctness.</p>

                    <span class="definition">A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet.</span>
                    <p>Key <strong class="key-term">Protocols</strong> (agreed-upon rules for communication):</p>
                    <span class="definition">A set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data between devices. Examples: IP, TCP, HTTP, DNS.</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong class="key-term">IP (Internet Protocol)</strong>: Addressing (IPv4, IPv6) and packet routing. Every device has an IP address.</li>
                        <span class="definition">The principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet. Defines addressing (IP addresses) and packet structure.</span>
                        <li><strong class="key-term">TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</strong>: Reliable, ordered data delivery (breaks data into packets, reassembles, retransmits if lost). Used for web, email.</li>
                        <span class="definition">A standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation through which application programs can exchange data. TCP works with IP to send packets between computers over the Internet. It provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets.</span>
                        <li><strong class="key-term">UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</strong>: Faster, but no guaranteed delivery/order (for streaming, games).</li>
                        <span class="definition">A simpler, connectionless Internet protocol in which error-checking and recovery services are not attempted. UDP is used when speed is desirable and error correction is not necessary, such as for live video streaming or online games.</span>
                        <li><strong class="key-term">DNS (Domain Name System)</strong>: Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., `google.com`) into IP addresses. Hierarchical system.</li>
                        <span class="definition">The Internet's system for converting alphabetic domain names (like `www.example.com`) into numerical IP addresses (like `93.184.216.34`) that computers use to connect to each other. It's a hierarchical and distributed naming system.</span>
                        <li><strong class="key-term">HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)</strong>: Protocol for the World Wide Web (fetching web pages). <strong class="key-term">HTTPS</strong> is the secure version using SSL/TLS.</li>
                        <span class="definition">HTTP: The underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. HTTPS (HTTP Secure): An extension of HTTP used for secure communication over a computer network, encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).</span>

                    <h3>Design Principles</h3>
                    <p><strong class="key-term">Hierarchy</strong>: Seen in IP addressing and DNS, allowing scalability by distributing responsibility.</p>
                    <span class="definition">A system or organization in which elements are arranged in levels of subordination or ranking. In the Internet, DNS and IP addressing are hierarchical, which helps with organization and scalability.</span>
                    <p><strong class="key-term">Redundancy</strong> & <strong class="key-term">Fault Tolerance</strong>: Multiple paths for data mean the Internet can withstand failures. If one link breaks, data can reroute.</p>
                    <span class="definition">Redundancy: The inclusion of extra components that are not strictly necessary to functioning, in case of failure in other components. Fault Tolerance: The property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components. The Internet's redundant pathways contribute to its fault tolerance.</span>
                    <p><strong class="key-term">Packet Switching</strong>: Data is broken into small <strong class="key-term">Packets</strong>, each with header (address, sequence) and payload. Packets can take different routes and are reassembled at the destination. Efficiently uses network resources.</p>
                    <span class="definition">Packet Switching: A method of grouping data into packets that are transmitted over a digital network. Packets are routed independently and may take different paths to the destination, where they are reassembled. Packet: A small unit of data transmitted over a packet-switched network. Contains a header (with addressing, routing info) and a payload (actual data).</span>
                    <p><strong class="key-term">Scalability</strong>: The Internet's design (open protocols, hierarchical addressing, end-to-end architecture) allows it to grow to billions of devices. IPv6 was introduced to provide more addresses than IPv4.</p>
                    <span class="definition">The capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. The Internet is designed to be highly scalable.</span>

                answer: "Lossless for archival, Lossy for email",
                explanation: "Lossless compression (e.g., PNG, TIFF) is best for archival because it preserves all original data, ensuring maximum quality. Lossy compression (e.g., JPEG) is suitable for email because it significantly reduces file size, making it easier to send, even though some quality is lost."

                options: ["To encrypt data for secure transmission.", "To ensure reliable delivery of data packets.", "To translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses.", "To assign IP addresses to new devices joining a network."],
                answer: "To translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses.",
                explanation: "DNS acts like the Internet's phonebook, converting user-friendly domain names (like www.example.com) into the numerical IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to locate each other."

                question: "A user receives an email that appears to be from their bank, asking them to click a link and verify their account details due to a 'security alert.' The link leads to a website that looks identical to the bank's official site but has a slightly different URL. This is an example of:",
                options: ["A DDoS attack", "Malware infection", "Phishing attack", "Symmetric encryption"],
                answer: "Phishing attack",
                explanation: "Phishing involves tricking users into divulging sensitive information by impersonating a trustworthy entity. The fake email and website are classic phishing techniques."

                options: ["16", "20", "22", "26"],
                answer: "22",
                explanation: "10110 in binary = (1 * 2^4) + (0 * 2^3) + (1 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0) = 16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 22."

                options: ["High computational cost of AI algorithms.", "Potential for bias in algorithms leading to unfair outcomes.", "Limited availability of AI development tools.", "AI algorithms are always 100% accurate."],
                answer: "Potential for bias in algorithms leading to unfair outcomes.",
                explanation: "If AI algorithms are trained on biased data or reflect societal biases in their design, they can perpetuate or even amplify unfairness in decision-making, which is a major ethical concern."

                question: "A procedure `calculatePrice(itemCost, taxRate)` is defined. If this procedure is called as `calculatePrice(100, 0.08)`, what do `100` and `0.08` represent?",
                options: ["Global variables", "Return values", "Local variables", "Arguments (or actual parameters)"],
                answer: "Arguments (or actual parameters)",
                explanation: "When a procedure is called, the values passed to it are known as arguments. These arguments are assigned to the procedure's parameters (`itemCost` and `taxRate` in this case) for use within the procedure."
            },
            {
                question: "Which Internet protocol is primarily responsible for breaking down messages into packets, adding sequence numbers, and ensuring all packets are reliably received and reassembled in the correct order at the destination?",
                options: ["IP (Internet Protocol)", "HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)", "UDP (User Datagram Protocol)", "TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)"],
                answer: "TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)",
                explanation: "TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of data. It handles packetization, sequencing, acknowledgments, and retransmissions to ensure data integrity."

                answer: "A list (or array) of strings",
                explanation: "A list (or array) is designed to hold a collection of items. Since book titles are text, a list of strings would be the most appropriate way to store multiple book titles."
