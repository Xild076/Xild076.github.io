<hr>
<p>Honestly, I'm not sure what compelled me to write this blog, but I thought I'd discuss my thoughts on fatalism.</p>
<p>Fatalist thought is a train of thought that I've had of on and off for a few years now. It started in freshman year of high school after reading the Three Body Problem series. Within the series was a crucial scene where one of the characters described how if he hit the billard ball in the exact same location, then the billard ball would always go to the same place. He did this because he wanted to show the main character the irrefutability of physics to contrast it with the refutability scientists found when performing particle collisions.</p>
<details>
  <summary>Spoilers!</summary>
  However, it turned out that the irrefutability was not a mistakeâ€”it was a result of interference by more advanced aliens.
</details>

<p>However, this book got to thinkâ€”if physics can find a rule in all aspects of the universe, does that mean that we live by some rule? This train of thought naturally lead me to question if we had free will at all. However, since I was pretty busy getting adjusted to high school, I put the train of thought to the side.</p>
<p>This train of thought came back to me almost a year ago after actually taking the AP Physics 1 class. From what I could tell, the world could be described by laws, and that means that we can be too. It didn't help that a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UebSfjmQNvs">kurzgesagt video</a> was released just as I was thinking about the topic, a video that only reinforced my opinion on the issue.</p>
<p>The video introduced two possible refutations to the idea of determinism: quantum physics and emergent properties.</p>
<p>Quantum physics was worth good consideration as it means our actions are not necessarily completely determined, however, there are two problems with that. First, our actions not being determined doesn't equate to possessing free willâ€”we still don't "make" those decisionsâ€”the random probability "makes" those decisions.</p>
<p>The idea of emergent properties, while seeming more compelling, is much less logically sound. While it does make a good point that concepts tend to emerge as the scale universal increases, it doesn't mean that the concepts are governed by separate rules. For instance, software is can be considered an emergent concept, however, it still most operate under the constraints of hardware, itself under the constraints of materials, so on and so forth until one gets back to the fundemental laws that define physics.</p>
<p>Thus, I came to a conclusionâ€”humans don't have free willâ€”our lives are not in our hands, even though we may believe they are. It did bring me both relief and profound sadness.</p>
<p>However, despite my convictions, I recently had a two small epiphanies that somewhat challenged my fatalist thoughts. </p>
<p>The first epiphany was that, in the end, all physics is derived from the observation of a limited amount of data. This though came when I was reading some ML papers and my math textbookâ€”I realized that in the end, we only have so much knowledge and so much data. While we have seen, through repeated trials, the accuracy of the laws we have derived, in the end, such laws may be only an approximate of what truly governs the universe as there is no way to truly prove that the laws are law. </p>
<p>Given this, there may be an aspect of the universe that we overlooked that may point to a true sentience and will for humans we haven't discovered yet. However, this is a far too optimistic train of thoughtâ€”while I have no way to prove the laws of physics, I have no way to disprove the laws of physics, thus, I may only accept determinism for now while still holding on to some hope of free will, however small.</p>
<p>The second epiphany started with Descartes' famous line: "I think therefore I am" and worked under a determinist mindset. I realized that, even if free will, thought, and subjectivity are all illusions created through emergent properties by the laws physics, they are real to me. I realized that, by looking at the universe, I had neglected to look within and around me. </p>
<p>Even if all I don't truly possess free will or subjectivity, I still feel that I have them and that is all I am afforded by the universe. Thus, indulging in determinist and fatalist though is useless. Even if our lives are predetermined, as long as we have the illusion of free will, then we must operate under such an illusion. When looking at society, humans were never once freeâ€”the need to eat, drink, and sleep all serve as driving forces behind our "free will". </p>
<p>However, it is what we choose to do with out limited or non-existant free will that matters.</p>
<p>Though, I do admit that a. this is not a philisophically satisfactory as it is almost a non-answer and b. fatalist though is hard to escape, I know that on a personal level. Still, even if I'm saying these words for my own motivation, I do think that learning to push free will to its limits is what defines humananity, especially if that free will is used for good.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
