Hi, I'm **Harry**, an **aspiring data scientist** and **AI** *(the behind the scenes type of AI)* **enthusiast**! I'm very interested implementing unique applications of AI in many different types of projects.

I'm currently a **junior at Leland High School** and have done a couple of research and development projects using AI, some of which include Stock Prediction, an AI Speech and Debate Coach, and a news objectifier. I have worked with **python for over 8 years** and have worked in **AI development for over 3 years**. I am good working with torch, sklearn, and numpy, the three big packages of AI development in python.

The two main reasons I develop AI systems are for **1.** a possible future employment prospect and **2.** for fun! I find the problem-solving aspect of AI development and programming overall fascinating, and it's always satisfying to come up with cool solutions to unique problems. 

I believe, on a more philosophical level, that AI systems and technology in general should, ideally, be used as **tools for the benefit of everyone**. While that is impossible, I aim to make my projects accessible and useful for everyone across the globe.

Outside of all this, I love reading! I especially love reading fantasy/scifi novels. While I haven't picked up any fun books recently due to a variety of reasons, some less mainstream titles I would highly recommend are: 

- The Three Body Problem *(the second book in particular)*

- Re:Zero *(technically a light novel but still one of my favorites)*

- Artemis Fowl *(more of a childhood classic, up to the fifth book)*

I also enjoy playing Hollow Knight, swimming, and last but not least: sleeping! My favorite drink is apple juice, my favorite color oscillates between green and black, and my favorite animal are cats!
