## AI Catalog - A learning experience

</center>

AI Catalog was made more a learning experience for me. I have worked a lot with AI and ML, however, I never fully understood how it worked. While I understood the concept of convergence by approximation, it wasn't enough for me to truly grasp the behind-the-scenes operations.

After doing a lot of research, I finally created AI Catalog as both a sum of my understanding of how the absolute fundementals of AI work and as an educational tool for others to use.

Thanks to:
 - [3 Blue 1 Brown for the great videos on backpropogation, those were very educational](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown)
 - [Karpathy for the amazing repo micrograd, it was very very helpful and was the framework off which I based all my code](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)

In the end, the following were created:
 - A backpropogation engine
 - Series of loss functions
 - Implementation of optimization
 - Basic implementations of PG and PPO

In the end, this was nothing more than the sum of a 10-week learning rabbit hole, and I hope that it proves to be helpful for anyone who wants to use it!
