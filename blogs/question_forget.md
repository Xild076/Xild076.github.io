This is going to be a short blog, both for the sake of time and for the fact that this thought is pretty simple.

There is a question I feel like a lot of us, including myself, are forgetting to ask ourselves. That question is: "Why?"

When I mean "Why?", I mean "Why are we doing what we do?"

"Why are we working so hard every day?"

And the answer for that questions seems pretty obvious for most of us: We work so hard to survive, lead a good life, or for the sake of our loved ones. 

However, something I noticed is that people have been slowly forgetting to ask and remember this fact. Instead, they begin to see the means of achieving this end as the end. 

For instance, the answer becomes not "I work hard to lead a good life" but "I work hard to get money". And this is applicable to myself—as a high school student, I often wonder if my end goal is to get into a good college or to live a good life.

This also affects the world at large—in today's society, the accumulation of wealth has more become wealth for the sake of wealth rather than wealth for the sake of a better life. At some point, money can only make your life better by so much, thus, wealth become more for building itself up.

And when that happens, I feel that people are hurt. Whether they be loved ones or unknown workers, when we forget why we are doing something, it becomes easy to forget ourselves. That is why I feel that it is really important we ask ourselves often: "Why?"
