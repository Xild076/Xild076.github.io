This is a quick introduction blogpost and a big of an explanation as to how this website was made!

## The Introduction

This website was made primarily to facilitate the posting of some of my projects and thoughts for easier access, both for myself and *certain individuals (Hello to any professors, college admissions officers lol)*. 

I will be consistantly updating this with project timelines, progress, and the occasional informal paper. Furthermore, I will post reviews and thoughts about any interesting papers I come across along with the occasional philosophy talk.

In general, this website is just meant to be a fun little showcase/experiment.

## The Creation

The creation of this website took heavy inspiration from Streamlit. The function building style of Streamlit is very easy to use, thus, I wanted to implement it in a much more toned-down style for Github websites. 

The process was suprisingly easy; all I had to do was get ChatGPT to spit out a bunch of HTML structures and compile all the HTML generated by the functions into an additional piece to put into the structure. Given how simple most of the HTML (ignoring the structural HTML), the code was easy to write; it was just a matter of creating a bunch of methods to add whatever was needed to a list to compile.

Overall, there are quite a lot of stuff I decided to add, the particularily unique ones being the timeline duo and widgets. The timeline was due to my wish to create a cohesive project timeline and it works well as a visualizer for progress. The widgets was inspired by how Github links show up on Discord with the image, text, and descriptions, and it works well as a clean redirect link.

Also, here is the placeholder image, its the cat from my pfp :D (Credit to Sooyun Choi for this amazing gif).

All things aside though, I hope whoever is reading this can take away something interesting from this website. Cheers!
