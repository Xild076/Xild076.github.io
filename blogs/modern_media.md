This blog is going to be a bit of a shorter one. Recently, I was reading [Quantum Criticism: A Tagged News Corpus Analysed for Sentiment and Named Entities by Badgujar et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05267), and it brought up a very interesting method: it assessed each news article for sentiment at a document, paragraph, and sentence level.

While small, I think this is a surprisingly important thing that needs to be considered when doing sentiment analysis—that the intent of a single statement can change wildly depending on the context. 

For instance, when a person says "I hope your dog is doing well.", it may seem nice on the surface, but if, say, the individual's conversational partner recently lost their dog, and the speaker is aware of it—the intent changes from being well-meaning to malicious.

I think this same concept applies in media and modern misinformation and bias, which is why I thought I'd come up with a quick list of all the ways in which I think bias may exist. These are not from a research paper but derived from my own experience, so I apologize if the wording is weird or inaccurate. 

The first is dictional bias. This bias is the one most people are familiar with—the bias that comes from the usage of words. Whether they be subtle, like changing the way an individual is addressed, or overt, like adding very harsh adjectives, these biases are usually the easiest to detect, yet, can often also be the most influential.

Next is structural bias. I believe that this bias is much more subtle and much harder to detect (and likewise resolve/remove). When I say structural, I mean positioning bits of information in such a way that certain pieces of information hold more weight than others. For instance, allocating half a paragraph to addressing criticism while spending ten other paragraphs in affirmation would structurally be biased towards a positive sentiment, even if the text presents the criticism and affirmation both in non-biased language.

The final type of bias is contextual bias. As mentioned at the start of this blog, this type of bias depends on an understanding of the situation. Often, some information is not included within a text, and that presents an issue if said information is critical to the topic. For instance, a news article could be written about a computer malfunction without explaining what caused this malfunction (which may be an external force), thus projecting a negative bias towards the computer even if the full story may present a neutral bias. This could alter the bias of the article depending on the nature of the information and can be both the easiest and hardest type of bias to detect depending on one's understanding of the full context.

While those are all the types of biases I personally know and see, they are still very general. I'll also continue to do my own research into types of biases, and I'd love to hear thoughts from anyone more knowledgeable than me on this topic.

Cheers!
