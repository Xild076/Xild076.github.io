# Entity Targeted Sentiment Analysis (Quantum Criticism)
Part of the Quantum Criticism Research Project with: Assistant Professor David Guy Brizan, Alex Pezcon, and Harry Yin (MAGICS Lab @ University of San Francisco)

## Overview
A unified, graph-centric pipeline for tracking how sentiment attaches to and evolves around entities and their aspects within any text. ETSA processes raw sentences one by one, builds a dynamic property graph of entities, entity interactions, and descriptive phrases. The graph scores sentiment at multiple levels to generate a final, entity-centric sentiment.
