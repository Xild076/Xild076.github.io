Hello everyone and welcome to my (totally real) Ted Talk, where today, I’m going to teach you how to teach an edgy teenager what a local minima is in machine learning. I wouldn’t call this a hard subject to teach, I think the ideas are pretty intuitive, but I thought it would be a funny exercise to throw my two cents into the ring and come up with some interesting ways of framing local minima in ML.

The first way I thought of framing it is through the lens of JP/KR/CN regression novels. Yes, I have read a few of them, and yes, I did unfortunately enjoy a few of them. Beyond my personal embarrassment, I imagine the main character of the story as our model and the good ending of the story as the absolute minimum. While most regression novels often have a linear path to improvement and victory, there are also many stories in which the main character needs to alter their entire worldview and trajectory in order to finally succeed in their regressions, stories like Re:Zero being perfect examples of this. 

Going back to the local minima in ML, sometimes, even if the MC can optimize their given route to the peak, this given route may not be the route that gives the ultimate, best result. Instead, doing another given route or taking slight deviations from the original route may give the best result, allowing them to reach the absolute minimum.

The second way I though of framing it was through the lens of Minecraft speedruns. In Minecraft speedruns, the goal is often to beat the Ender Dragon as fast as possible, and runners have optimized the routes that they need to take to get such a fast time down to a tee (for set seed runs, not random seed ones). However, even if the runner’s route is perfect, the seed is often not so much. Every few months or so, we see a new, even better seed be found, pushing the ultimate limit even further.

Tying back to ML, even if the run on a single seed is optimized to its local minimum, its just a single seed, ignoring those possible seeds that may serve as the absolute, fastest time. 

This was a short one and included just some random thoughts on ML, hope you liked it!

Cheers!
