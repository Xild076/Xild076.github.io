I was kind of bored, and I thought: why not get into some creative writing? Reading and writing has been one of my most enjoyable pastimes for a while now, and I was curious: would I fare well at writing a short story? So, I took my shot, sat down for about an hour, and here it is! It's probably not super good, but hey, I'm pretty happy with it lol. Hope anyone reading this enjoys this as much as I did writing it ;D. Who knows, I might do this again, it really was a lot of fun.


The Frog Who Cried Rain

Once upon a time, there was a small village in a small woodland marsh. It was a simple village and did all that a village would do: farm, feast, drink, and sleep. One day, however, the village chief, while visiting the village well for a pail of water, saw a frog sitting on the well’s edge. 

It was not a large frog; it was small like the village, and it was simple too, a dull green like so many of its kind. Yet when the village chief came, it looked at him and called, “Ribbit ribbit.” Then, not a second later, rain began pouring down from the sky. 

“By golly!” the chief cried, “Did the frog just call down rain?” So the chief, pail over his head to shield from the rain, picked up the frog and ran back to his abode, where he excitedly told his wife about the frog. 

“Why, it must have been a coincidence!” his wife laughed, and the frog seemed to laugh too: “Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.”

However, the chief was stubborn in his insistence. So the next day, once the rain cleared, he took his wife and a few friends out with the frog in hand. Then, he said, “We wait until the frog calls!”

So they waited, until the sun crossed half the sky and dark clouds had rolled in, then the frog cried, “Ribbit ribbit,” and rain came pouring down.

“My goodness!” the people cried, “The frog did call down the rain!”

And so the village believed. A small shrine was built where the frog would lay, lazily eating flies as they came and went. And when it would call “Ribbit ribbit,” the watcher would ring a bell as rain began to fall.

Yet as time passed, the frog began to cry out less. At first, it was no cause for alarm: the frog was powerful, yes, but even gods had their limits. However, soon, the ground began to dry and form cracks, crops began to die, and the people began to grow hungry.

“Why won’t you cry!” they called to the frog, who was still lazily eating flies, but the frog could offer no response. So they looked to the village chief, who sat in his room, thinking long and hard. The frog wasn’t crying, he knew this was the cause of the long dry spell, yet the question was why? He pondered, deeply at that, when he realized. “The frog must be displeased!” he shouted, “Even the most humble of gods need sacrifices."

So the village went to work, gathering what meager grain and worldly possessions they had to offer to the frog. The frog did not respond; it still continued lazily eating its flies. So the villagers left their possessions there in front of the frog for the frog to take.

The next morning, all the food was gone, though many worldly possessions still remained. “I was right!” the chief proclaimed, “The frog is displeased by our meager sacrifice of flies, we must offer more for it to be satisfied and for it to grant us the rain we so desperately need.”

The stores of grain were near empty, but the chief insisted grain be carried out. “There is no measure in extending our pitiable lives for mere moments more when this sacrifice shall bring us prosperity!” he said to the village, and the village nodded: indeed, the frog had never let them down.

Thus the grain vanished one by one, yet the frog still did not cry. The village chief was once again back to ruminating, sitting on a wooden stool, overlooking his people as they surrounded the frog. The frog demanded sacrifice, yet they had no more food to sacrifice. The frog would also not accept possessions of wood and clay, so what was there to give? His eyes drifted to a little girl standing next to her mother, no more than ten, thin enough to be mistaken for a skeleton with skin.

A small alter of wood was cobbled together from a table and some sticks. He had quelled the mother’s protests and convinced her to accept the sacrifice for the sake of her other three children in desperate need of food and water. “Oh great frog,” he called, stepping up to the alter where the thrashing girl lay, trussed and gagged like a chicken, “we offer you this greatest of sacrifices, for you to call down the rain.” His borrowed butcher’s knife, dulled by years of use, gleamed.

Yet the frog did not cry. It remained silent, still lazily eating flies. After that, the chief became a hollow man, locking himself in his room. As for the village, some fled and others starved overnight. 

Time passed, and when the chief finally emerged from his room, he looked as if half his foot was in the grave. He tiredly walked into village, now a ghost of its former self, empty and dry. He arrived at the small shrine, and in it, no frog lay. He sighed, and as he did, he felt a wet drop hit his face.

The rain had finally come.
