Now that my first experience in doing proper academic research is almost over, I thought I'd write a small blog reflecting on what I learned in this experience. I do have to say, it's a very interesting experience, and I really want to do more in the future, whether by myself or for academia. However, that aside, let me go into some takeaways I had from this experience.

First of all, I learned that you must have a proper research question. I think this was the biggest issue with our project; we had a solid idea of what we were trying to do, however, it wasn't clearly outlined. While this did help us in a sense; it let us shift around the final focus of the project from explainability and accuracy to just explainability, it was ultimately confusing.

Second of all, I learned that testing must be done early! This was my biggest mistake; I kept chasing a higher accuracy until the last minute, and that was not a good idea. I wasn't even able to improve accuracy all that much, and it caused much undue stress. Thus, I realized: good is good enough :D.

Third of all, I learned that keeping a a proper git system is very, very important. Rollbacks are extremely critical to maintaining stability, and... I didn't for a long time during the project, and that posed a solid problem, unfortunately. However, I did learn my lesson and now, my git usage has improved at least somewhat (I hope), and I was able to use rollbacks in the last few days of the project.

I didn't actually have much thoughts on the writing of the paper itself, I found that part to be the most simple out of all the steps in the project. The only isuse was cutting stuff down, but that wasn't much of an issue as all the information was already present.

That's all for today's thoughts, it's a short one, but it's also more of a reflection for myself. Cheers!
