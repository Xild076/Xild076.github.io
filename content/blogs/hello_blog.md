This is a quick introduction blogpost and a big of an explanation as to how this website was made!

## The Introduction

This website was made primarily to serve as a hub for the posting of some of my projects and thoughts for easier access, both for myself and *certain individuals (Hello to any professors or college admissions officers lol)*. 

I will be regularly updating this with: 

- Project timelines and progress updates

- Informal papers and AI-related blogposts

- Reviews and thoughs on interesting research papers

- Occasional philosophy or random musings

In general, this website is just meant to be a fun little showcase/experimentâ€”part portfolio, part blog, and part playground for ideas.

## The Creation

The creation of this website took heavy inspiration from Streamlit, a python tool I use often for creating websites.

The issue I have with website creation is that I can't do HTML or CSS for the life of me. However, what I can do is python, and Streamlit was a very useful method to easily create websites. Unfortunately, Streamlit didn't provide the raw HTML in a very customizable way, thus, I decided to do what I do best and recreate basic Streamlit functions by myself!

The process itself was relatively simple: get ChatGPT to generate a bunch of structural HTML data, create a set of functions to add HTML to the structure, create a function to compile all the HTML, and finally make the website with the new tools. Overall, it was a pretty lightweight way to easily craft a website in python and it only took one night to make thanks to ChatGPT.

Beyond the standard Streamlit functions, I also added some of my own custom elements that I thought would come into handy. First, I made a timeline system to create a cohesive and cool-looking project history which helps visualize progress over time. I also created "widgets", these little redirect blocks with a picture, title, and description. The "widgets" were inspired from Discord's link visualization.

Overall, its some pretty neat stuff, and if yall want to use it, just copy the code from Github or something :D.

All things aside though, I hope whoever is reading this can take away something interesting from this passion project of a website. Cheers!
